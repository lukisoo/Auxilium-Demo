# Auxilium-Demo
Auxilium is a web app that provides a beginner-friendly developer community. Our aim is to allow beginner developers to help each other, connect with one another, and encourage them to gain more skills and opportunities.

This project was built over 48 hours at the 2021 DEVS Hackathon, and secured us 3rd place.

# Motivation
The lack of a beginner-friendly developer community is an issue, and one that our team were all very familiar with. Everyone starts out as a 'beginner' at some point - yet there are insufficient sites or tools that currently exist to help them to learn and ask questions at a basic level. It can also be very intimidating for beginner developers to enter the world of more experienced developers. Hence, we decided to targe this issue and create a community to target these issues ourselves. While there are other sites and tools out there that help developers (e.g. stack overflow), they often provide quite a hostile environment towards those who are new.

# Tech Stack
We created our site using React and Firebase for our login system + our Q&A feature, however most of the firebase has been removed from this public repo to prevent any accidental charges. Please do note I ended up learning react in the middle of this hackathon, so the code is, well, very ugly.
